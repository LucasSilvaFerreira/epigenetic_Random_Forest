Separating enhancers and promoters using Random Forest 

This is a simple demostration of how to use Random Forest to separate enhancers from promoters.  
The feature importance was extracted using the gini index obtained in the training process.  
How expected the H3K4ME3 is very important to separate transcribed regions (promoters) .
Different enhancers can prenset different rates of H3k27ac, showing the actiivty level of that enchancer.
